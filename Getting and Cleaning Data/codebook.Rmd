#Data Results
A selection of 30 volunteers were used in an experiment in which they would be required 
to complete six activities. These activities ranged from walking, walking upstairs, 
walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying down. The data was collected by having
each volunteer wear a Samsung Galaxy II smart phone near their waste. The device has built
in technology that allows data to be captured regarding movement. The group was broken 
into two sections, one comprised of 70% of the volunteers and the other the remaing 30%. 
The group which accounted for 30% would be used to collect test data results and the 
group which accounted for 70% would be used to collect training data results.
